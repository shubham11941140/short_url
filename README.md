To run the website, go to: **http://ec2-54-173-198-224.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8000/home**

To check the performance overhead of the website by using CURL API call, open the Linux command line
and run the **performance.py** file. If you wish to edit the parameters for testing, you are free to do so.

```
python3 performance.py
```

Do not use **Copy to Clipboard** as we are running this on a non secure cloud server as the SSH has not been established.

The Clipboard functionality works only in a secure environment which we will create as the project moves on
